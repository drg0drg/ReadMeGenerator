# Read Me Generator
    

## Description 
    
Read Me Generator is a Node.JS small app that helps in quickly building README.md files for projects. 

It provides a template in which the user answers the questions in order to automatically generate a readme file called _MyReadMe.md_. Using a GitHub API call run through an axios method, the app builds the _Author_ and _Contact_ section with the author GitHub profile picture and contact. 

The contents can then be transferred to the specific projects README.md file having the advantage that all the markdown files have the same coherent structure for all the applications.
